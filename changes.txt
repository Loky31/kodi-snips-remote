TV mode: 
I made a tag "tv" for shows in Kodi and add all my shows which i can watch in shuffle order like friends, how i met your mother..
I made a smart playlist named "tv" for every show with tag "tv" and set sort to random.
If i say "hey snips watch tv" the playlist "tv" will be played so a random episode of a random show with the tag "tv" will be 
played just like when i turn on the tv and watch whatever is played

Music:
when i say "hey snips play the radio" snips will turn on the party mode to play random music from the kodi library.

added the ability to play songs from a genre and an album 

Shuffle can now set to on and off instead of just switching the actual state.

Kodi wakeup will simulate a up key press to wake up kodi from stand by

Speedup the webRTC by deleting all unnecessary things
